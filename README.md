# Keylogger Detector
Warns the user when a malicious process tries to send data from your machine.

## Description
Anti-viruses act as a first line of defence against keyloggers, but often they are unable to detect the viruses and the computer ends up being infected.
Keylogger Detector aims to provide another layer of defence by providing a monitoring tool that monitors the common ways keyloggers send information from the computers to the hacker and warns the users for the same.
